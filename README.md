In the requirement specification for the ClassyCrafT UML Diagram Maker (Specifikacija_ClassyCraft.pdf), I provided a thorough introduction, outlining the app's concept, intended users, and a competitive analysis that highlights our strengths. The document also covers functional, optional, and advanced requirements, ensuring that all necessary features are well-defined. Non-functional requirements are detailed as well. A key component of the specification is the use case diagram, which visually represents the primary interactions within the system. This diagram is crucial for understanding the application's functionality and is included as a central part of the document.

In short, the idea behind this project was to create a tool for making UML diagrams similar to what you can do in Visual Paradigm.

In developing this project, several design patterns were utilized, including Singleton, Observer, EventBus, Composite, Simple Factory (which covers Factory Method), State, and Command patterns. Additionally, the project features serialization and deserialization capabilities.

In the application itself, you can create UML diagrams
